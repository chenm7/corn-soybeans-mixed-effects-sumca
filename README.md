# Summary

This project was done in collaboration with Samayita Bhattacharjee, Emily Chang, and Russell Okino at the University of California, Davis. We analyzed satellite data of Iowa crop data using mixed effects models, including finding empirical best unbiased linear predictors (EBLUPs) of population mean crop areas in twelve different counties. Additionally, we applied a novel new method called SUMCA to estimate the mean squared prediction errors of the EBLUPs. Theoretical derivations and discussions about the methodology are included in our report.
